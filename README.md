----- Dataset -------
<br>

**Android App Market on Google Play**

Dataset for challenge is available at the dataset/ folder under this repo.

Let's take a look at the data, which consists of two files:

* `apps.csv`: contains all the details of the applications on Google Play. There are 13 features that describe a given app.
* `user_reviews.csv`: contains 100 reviews for each app, most helpful first. The text in each review has been pre-processed and attributed with three new features: Sentiment (Positive, Negative or Neutral), Sentiment Polarity and Sentiment Subjectivity.

 
**ðŸ’¡ Hint:**
1. **Dataset must be cleaned since it has a few raw contents**
2. **You'll have to merge both `app.csv` and `users_reviews.csv` on App column (its a common column/feature in both the .csv files) in order to perform data-analyzation more effeciently**

All columns of the both csv files dataset are very much understandable, so we are not sharing detailed info on each column
